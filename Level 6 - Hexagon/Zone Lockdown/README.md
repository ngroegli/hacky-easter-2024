# Challenge "Zone Lockdown"
![Banner Image](banner.jpg)

This is an emergency! Your network was infiltrated, and you immediately need to initiate a zone lockdown!

You do have access to the system (user minion), and you know the lockdown script.

But damn, one must become the boss to execute it!

Notes:

- there are multiple instances running - if yours is broken, switch to another one
- ssh ch.hackyeaster.com -l minion -p <PORT> where <PORT> is one of: 2411, 2412, 2413, 2414
- password for both minion and boss: letmein
- script to run: /home/boss/lockdown.sh
- you'll be kicked off a server if the lockdown is triggered by someone else
- the servers are restarted every hour at x:00
