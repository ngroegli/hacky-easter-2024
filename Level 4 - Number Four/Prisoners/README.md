Prison guards found a snippet of paper with a hand-written message:


    Hello! This message is for John. He is in block A, 12. 10 days ago, 12 am, 14th of July you asked me about my friends out there. O{h, awesome what they managed to do! We will certainly succeed. I don't think there will be any problems. I now need to organize how, we, us will start. Ideally you know it, past reading this message. My best regards. O}k

There seems to be a hidden message in there. Can you find it?
