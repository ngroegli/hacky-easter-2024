This time, Bunny Bob was lost in thoughts. "I cracked your code", the young bunny from before told him. "Is this using the same number again? It's irrational to think this would work twice."

"No", Bob replied. "It's not that irrational at all, when you have a closer look."

"But my approach doesn't work here at all!" Bunny Bob sighed.

"It's the same mechanic. Just don't start at the beginning. Start right after every hacker's birthday."

His young friend looked at him quizzically and hopped away, none the wiser.

Here's the encoded flag:
