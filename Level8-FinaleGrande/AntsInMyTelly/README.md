Tired of fuzzy, soft, nice things, the bunnies are watching a nature video about spiders and ants.

But what's that?

<video controls src="ants_in_my_telly.mp4" title="Title"></video>

# Solution
## Getting the relevant parts from the video
I used for editing the video initially https://ezgif.com :
- For croping to the pixeled area: https://ezgif.com/crop-video/
- For cutting to the correct length of the pixeled area: https://ezgif.com/cut-video/

The output can be found in ./working_files/only_codes_from_video

<video controls src="working_files/only_codes_from_video/cutted_video.mp4" title="Title"></video>

## Transforming the cutted video to frames
With the help of ChatGPT, I could generate a method to export each frame into a single image:

    def extract_frames(video_path, output_folder):
        # Create output folder if it doesn't exist
        if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
            os.makedirs(output_folder)

        # Open the video file
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
        # Read the video frames
        success, frame = cap.read()
        frame_count = 0

        # Loop through frames
        while success:
            # Save frame as an image
            frame_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f"frame_{frame_count}.jpg")
            cv2.imwrite(frame_path, frame)

            # Read next frame
            success, frame = cap.read()
            frame_count += 1

        # Release the video capture object
        cap.release()
        print("Frames extracted successfully.")

## Calculate grid values
After that, I created another method with ChatGPT to calculate an avg pixel color for all pixels over all images. The result had to be exported into a new image:

    def calculate_average_image(folder_path):
        images = []
        
        # Iterate through all files in the folder
        for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
            if filename.endswith('.jpg') or filename.endswith('.jpg'):  # Assuming images are jpg or png
                image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
                image = cv2.imread(image_path)
                if image is not None:
                    images.append(image)
        
        # Calculate average image
        if len(images) > 0:
            average_image = np.mean(images, axis=0).astype(np.uint8)
            return average_image
        else:
            print("No images found in the folder.")
            return None

With this, I could generate the following image which seems to look like a grid:

![average_image.jpg](average_image.jpg)

## Resize average calculated image
For making the grid detection easier, I tried to resize the video, so each grid-cell would be exaxtly one pixel big. This could be archive by using the following lines (grid width 40px, grid length 55px):

    # Open the image
    image = Image.open("average_image.jpg")
    # Resize the image to width 40 and height 55
    resized_image = image.resize((40, 55))
    # Save the resized image
    resized_image.save("average_image_resized.jpg")

![average_image_resized.jpg](average_image_resized.jpg)

## Parse grid
Now I needed a method, which translates pixel to value. Here I take 1 as clear white and 0 for not white. The method looks like that and was also created with the help of ChatGPT:

    def parse_grid_in_binary_file(image_path):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    
    # Convert image to grayscale
    gray_image = image.convert('L')
    
    # Get width and height of the image
    width, height = gray_image.size
    
    cipher = []
    # Iterate through each row of the image
    for y in range(height):
        # Get the pixel values of the current row
        row_pixels = list(gray_image.getdata())[y * width: (y + 1) * width]
        
        # Find the index of the whitest pixel (pixel with maximum value)
        white_index = row_pixels.index(max(row_pixels))
        
        # Initialize a list to store the binary values
        binary_values = []
        
        # Iterate through each pixel in the row
        for x, pixel_value in enumerate(row_pixels):
            # Append '0' if the pixel is not the whitest, otherwise append '1'
            binary_values.append('1' if x == white_index else '0')
        
        # Write the binary values of the row to the text file
        cipher.append(''.join(binary_values))
    return cipher

Output:

## Decrypting cipher
With some hints from Discord, I could figure out that each line could be a character and the algorithm could be a transposition cipher. Because of the flag-format he2024{...}, the first and the last entries are known.

        key = []
        for i, t in enumerate("he2024{"):
            entry = {
                "index": cipher_lines[i].index('1'),
                "value": t
            }
            if entry not in key:
                key.append(entry)
        
        key.append({
            "index": cipher_lines[len(cipher_lines)-1].index('1'),
            "value": "}"
        })  

Besides that, I also created a method for frequency analysis:

    def print_frequency_anaylsis(cipher_lines):
        frequencies = []
        for line, line_value in enumerate(cipher_lines):
            value = cipher_lines[line].index('1')
            found = False
            for index, entry in enumerate(frequencies):
                if not found:
                    if entry["value"] == value:
                        frequencies[index]["count"] = frequencies[index]["count"] + 1
                        found = True

            if not found:
                frequencies.append({
                    "value": value,
                    "count": 1
                })

        sorted_frequencies = sorted(frequencies, key=lambda d: d['count'], reverse=True)
        for entry in sorted_frequencies:
            print(entry)

Output:

    {'value': 16, 'count': 10}
    {'value': 22, 'count': 4}
    {'value': 1, 'count': 4}
    {'value': 8, 'count': 4}
    {'value': 13, 'count': 4}
    {'value': 17, 'count': 3}
    {'value': 26, 'count': 3}
    # and so on

Since we can assume that we have a quite long leet speak text, value 16 is probably an underscore. So by using these known facts, we can already know that the final flag might look like the following (- is unknown):

    he2024{-_-0----_-h-_-h---_----_h--_--_--_-_----e-_-00-}

And now I had to make a very long try and error process to test several possible keys and to try to derive from new output further keys. This was a lot of bruteforcing and in the end even required me to test some flags against the site. If it did not work, I went back to my keys and tried other combinations like changing 5 and s or O and o. This was very time consuming but in the end, those key-values could be figured out with frequency analysis and bruteforcing:

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 0,
        "value": "1"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 10,
        "value": "w"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 18,
        "value": "n"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 17,
        "value": "d"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 8,
        "value": "3"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 26,
        "value": "r"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 19,
        "value": "y"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 36,
        "value": "s"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 21,
        "value": "p"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 15,
        "value": "b"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 11,
        "value": "a"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 33,
        "value": "j"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 29,
        "value": "u"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 34,
        "value": "?"
    })

    key.append({  # Test
        "index": 25,
        "value": "o"
    })

By using this key against the grid, I could derive somewhen the flag.

The full code can be found here: [solver.py](solver.py)

Note: Most likely there is a way without bruteforce, but I could not find it.
