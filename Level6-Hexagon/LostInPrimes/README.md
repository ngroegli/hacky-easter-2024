One of our Prime eggs is lost.

It was last seen at [http://factordb.com/](factordb.com).

The only thing we know is that it has not yet been proven that it is really prime, and has more than 27000 digits.

Hint: Find a way to list / download numbers from the server, and search by what you can read and see here. Someone leaked parts of the number, check the download.

# Solution
From the leaked_part.png we can see that all visible numbers are 0 or 1. With the search feature, we can generate a download URL to get primes from the DB:

    mindig = 27000
    perpage = integer
    start = integer
    download = 1 for true
    http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=1&mindig={mindig}&perpage={perpage}&start={start}&download={download}

Based on the above, we can generate a script to consume all the primes with the above URL. But we have to make sure that we consume them in small steps and that we filter for values that mostly start with 0 and 1. I assume that we only have 0 and 1, but I left some wiggle room in my filter since we do not know for sure that there are only 0 and 1 in the number. Primes that match the criteria are stored in an output.txt:

[consumer.py](consumer.py)

    import requests

    def consume_factor_db_primes(min_digits,perpage):
        for start in range(0, 10000000, perpage):
            url = "http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=1&mindig={0}&perpage={1}&start={2}&download=1".format(min_digits,perpage,start)
            response = requests.get(url) 
            response.raise_for_status()
            body = response.content.decode()
            numbers = body.split('\n')
            for number in numbers:
                if number[0:120].count('0') + number[0:120].count('1') > 100 and number[0:120].count('1') >= 8:
                    f = open("output.txt", "a")
                    f.write(number)
                    f.write("\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
                    f.close()



    def main():
        consume_factor_db_primes(27000,500)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

By going through the output.txt in VSCode, the flag instantly gets visible (maybe this was luck to see...):

To make it better for scanning, I exported the QR of the flag to [flag_qr_only.txt](flag_qr_only.txt) which can be parsed easly.

For parsing, I made this script which replaces '1' with '‚ñà':

[flag_generator.py](flag_generator.py)

    def display_flag_from_qr_text():
        f = open("flag_qr_only.txt", "r")
        text = f.read()
        print(text.replace('1','‚ñà'))



    def main():
        display_flag_from_qr_text()


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

When executing the flag_generator, I have set the console color to black/white and scanned the QR:
